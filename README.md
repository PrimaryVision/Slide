Slide is an open-source, ad-free [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) browser for
Android. It is based around the
[Java Reddit API Wrapper](https://github.com/mattbdean/JRAW).

Slide is available here on [GitHub](https://github.com/) in
[releases](https://github.com/edgan/Slide/releases), and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.edgan.redditslide&hl=en_US). I plan
[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) in the future.

There is an active community for Slide on the
[/r/slidereddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slidereddit) subreddit,
which anybody is welcome to join.

### Issues
In any project it's likely that a few bugs will slip through the cracks, so it
helps greatly if people document any bugs they find to ensure that they get
fixed promptly.

You can view a list of known issues and feature requests using
[the issue tracker](https://github.com/edgan/Slide/issues).
If you don't see your issue (or you aren't sure), feel free to
[submit it!](https://github.com/edgan/Slide/issues/new).

Where appropriate, a screenshot works wonders to help us see exactly what the
issue is. You can upload screenshots directly using the GitHub issue tracker or
by attaching a link (to Imgur, for example), whichever is easier for you.

### Translations
If you are able to contribute a translation into a language missing from Slide,
or spot any room for improvement in an existing translation, we greatly
appreciate anything you can assist with!

This project uses [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/slide-reddit). Not to be
confused with the original project's
[Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/slide-for-reddit). It is a platform that
allows anybody to contribute to translating the app with as many words at a time
as they want. Crowdin provides a nice interface for translating, and no
knowledge of the code is needed.

### Code
If you are a developer and wish to contribute to the app, please fork the
project and submit a pull request.
