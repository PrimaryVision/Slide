# Current project status
This project is back with this fork, and is being **maintained**.

# Setup
See [SETUP.md](/docs/SETUP.md)

# Android device debugging via USB
See [DEBUGGING.md](/docs/DEBUGGING.md)

# Updates
The easiest way to get updates, outside the
[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.edgan.redditslide&hl=en_US),
is [Discoverium](https://github.com/cygnusx-1-org/Discoverium/). It has a search
function, and lets you add apps to the list for keeping the apps updated.

# Issues
In any project it's likely that a few bugs will slip through the cracks, so it
helps greatly if people document any bugs they find to ensure that they get
fixed promptly.

You can view a list of known issues and feature requests using
[the issue tracker](https://github.com/edgan/Slide/issues).
If you don't see your issue (or you aren't sure), feel free to
[submit it!](https://github.com/edgan/Slide/issues/new).

Where appropriate, a screenshot works wonders to help us see exactly what the
issue is. You can upload screenshots directly using the GitHub issue tracker or
by attaching a link (to Imgur, for example), whichever is easier for you.

If you are a developer and wish to contribute to the app, please fork the
project and submit a pull request.
